# GPACalc

GPACalc is a simple calculator designed for NEU students to calculate their Grade Point Average (GPA). Since the AAO website of NEU only provides the General GPA calculated from all scores, it is very incovenient for students who wish to check how well are they doing in a particular semester. GPACalc is the solution.

GPACalc bases on WxWidgets and SQLite3. While the former provides a GUI front-end, the latter provides a mean to store, retrieve and calculate data.

It is my first complete program work, and I JUST KNOW it is full of places that needs improvement. If you have any advice, just open up an issue or write to me at nickp2003@163@com (Please remove the latter At-Symbol, this is to prevent spambot), I will reach out to you as soon as possible.
